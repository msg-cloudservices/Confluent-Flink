This repository contains the code for our project testing Confluent's integration of AI Model Inference on Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink. We used the Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset and wrote an accompanying blog article providing hands-on instructions how to build this usecase yourself.
The link to the blog will shortly be published here.
